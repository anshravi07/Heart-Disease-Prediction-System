                                <h5>What is the Heart Disease Prediction Tool?</h5>
                                <p>This tool uses machine learning to assess your risk of heart disease based on key health parameters. It analyzes the information you provide and compares it to patterns found in medical data to estimate your risk level.</p>
                                
                                <h5>How accurate is this prediction?</h5>
                                <p>Our model has been trained on medical datasets and achieves approximately 85-90% accuracy. However, it's important to understand that this is not a medical diagnosis. Many factors influence heart health that may not be captured by the limited parameters we collect.</p>
                                
                                <h5>Should I rely on this tool for medical advice?</h5>
                                <p>No. This tool is for educational and informational purposes only. Always consult with a qualified healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment. This tool can help you understand potential risk factors, but it cannot replace professional medical evaluation.</p>

                                <h5>What is heart disease?</h5>
                                <p>Heart disease refers to various conditions that affect the heart's structure and function. The most common type is coronary artery disease, which affects blood flow to the heart and can lead to heart attacks.</p>
                                
                                <h5>What are the common symptoms of heart disease?</h5>
                                <p>Common symptoms include chest pain or discomfort, shortness of breath, pain or numbness in the legs or arms, pain in the neck, jaw, throat, or back, and fatigue. However, some people may not experience symptoms until a heart attack occurs.</p>
                                
                                <h5>What are the major risk factors for heart disease?</h5>
                                <p>Major risk factors include age, sex, family history, smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, excessive alcohol consumption, and stress.</p>

                                <p>Heart disease risk increases with age. After 45 for men and 55 for women, the risk significantly increases.</p>
                                
                                <h5>Sex</h5>
                                <p>Men generally have a higher risk of heart disease than women. However, after menopause, women's risk increases and eventually equals that of men.</p>

                                    <strong>Typical Angina (0):</strong> Chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart.<br>

                                <p>Normal blood pressure is typically around 120/80 mm Hg. High blood pressure (hypertension) is a major risk factor for heart disease.</p>
                                
                                <h5>Maximum Heart Rate (thalach)</h5>
                                <p>This is the highest heart rate achieved during exercise. A lower maximum heart rate may indicate cardiovascular issues.</p>
